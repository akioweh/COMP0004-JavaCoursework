# DEPRECATED: Renderers Package

This package is deprecated and should not be used in new code. It has been replaced by a more idiomatic Jakarta EE approach using JSP tag files.

## New Rendering Architecture

The new rendering architecture uses JSP tag files located in `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/tags/` to render different types of elements:

- `text_element.tag`: Renders text elements
- `html_element.tag`: Renders HTML elements
- `link_element.tag`: Renders link elements
- `media_element.tag`: Renders media elements
- `text_element_edit.tag`: Renders the edit form for text elements
- `html_element_edit.tag`: Renders the edit form for HTML elements
- `link_element_edit.tag`: Renders the edit form for link elements
- `media_element_edit.tag`: Renders the edit form for media elements
- `element.tag`: Dispatches to the appropriate tag file based on the element type

This approach provides better separation of concerns, making the UI more maintainable and easier to extend.

## Why This Package Is Deprecated

The old rendering architecture had several issues:
1. It mixed presentation logic (HTML generation) with business logic
2. It was not flexible or maintainable
3. It didn't leverage JSP/JSF for templating and component-based UI development
4. It didn't provide good separation of concerns
5. It was error-prone and hard to maintain

The new architecture addresses these issues by using JSP tag files, which are a more idiomatic approach for Jakarta EE applications.
